# telegram-bot and payment app

Bot responds to three basic commands:
- /start            -> greets the user
- /balance          -> tells you your virtual balance (starting balance is 1000$)
- /bet <amount>     -> bets the amount you give, giving you a chance to double the amount or lose it with 50% probability and writes the win or loose message
